## Attende
_Attende_ was a freelance work that I did back in 2005 when I was still coursing my bachelor's in CS. The purpose was to design a "virtual card" for a CRM software development company in Brazil. The virtual card would be distributed among partner corporations and business audiences in tech events and fairs. It was intended to be launched automatically from a CD-ROM in full-screen mode.

To put the work in a historical perspective, this was a time when broadband Internet was still expensive and slow for most users in Brazil, even in the corporative sector of my home state... so delivering the information in a rich and interactive way using a CD-ROM made complete sense. I had to visit my client several times to understand how the company worked, what value they delivered in their main services, and finally what information and image they exactly wished to convey to their target audience. In the beginning, some staff in the company thought the CD-ROM should serve as an advertisement vehicle while others thought that it should serve as a portfolio. In the end, they agreed that it shouldn't aim to exhaust any of the previous purposes, but rather work as a modern tech invitation card, to catch the eyes of potential clients since most software development houses in the region were still using paper cards and brochures.
