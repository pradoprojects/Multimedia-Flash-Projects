# Pre-Undergrad Projects

These are projects that I developed in the late 90s/ early 2000s when I was about 15 years old and an enthusiast of Macromedia Flash.

Some of the projects were ordered by my high-school teachers, as a way to teach classes more playfully. These were times when computers were a kind of mystic device in Brazil and Flash Animations was a WOW wizardry compared to PowerPoint 98 slides.

Thanks to Flash, I could have contact with ActionScript -- my first programing language.

It may look silly nowadays but it took a lot of effort and inspiration in those times to build animations in an AMD 800 MHz Athlon PC. It felt amazing to explore all the resources provided in the Flash tool! Thank you Macromedia team, wherever you might be. 

Have fun! ðŸŽ‰


Ps.: _If you have a windows machine you can watch the .exe files or use the players available in this repo (flashplayer_32_sa_debug.exe) to watch the SWF files._
