# Pre-Undergrad

These are projects that I developed in the early 2000s when I was 16 years old and an enthusiast of Macromedia Flash.

Some of the projects were ordered by my high-school teachers, as a way to transmit the class content in a more playful way. These were times when computers were a kind of mystic device and Flash Animations was a WOW magic when compared to PowerPoint 98 slides.

Thanks to Flash, I could have contact with ActionScript -- my first programing language.
